# **Rust GUI Overlay Modification**

This project is a custom overlay tool designed to enhance gameplay visuals by rendering shapes and graphics over a game window. It leverages Win32 and GDI+ APIs for lightweight, high-performance drawing.

## **Features**
- Transparent overlay that integrates seamlessly over the game window.
- Rendering of colored unfilled rectangles, cooresponding to in game information.

## **Disclaimer**
⚠️ **This tool was developed and tested exclusively in a private server environment.**  
Using this tool on public servers **can and will** result in bans. This project was never intended to bypass the anti-cheat, and as such, it would be easily detected.

**I am not responsible for any consequences arising from use of this project. This is intended solely for educational purposes. Please use responsibly and only in environments where it is explicitly permitted.**

## **Requirements**
- Windows OS with support for GDI+ APIs.
- A private server or local testing environment, where the anti cheat is disabled on both the client and the server.

## **Setup**
1. Clone the repository
2. Run build/BuildAll.bat (note: this requires g++ to be installed already)
3. Run the resulting exe while the game is open
