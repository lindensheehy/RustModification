# Screenshots

These screenshots were pulled from a clip I recorded when I first finished the overlay. I wasn’t picky about perfect captures, so some images show the overlay’s inaccuracies. These aren’t intentional — it’s just how the app really looks.

Despite the wonky graphics at times, this project is technically deep and challenging, which is exactly why I’m proud to share it here.

I’m not trying to make myself look good or bad — just telling it like it is. :P
